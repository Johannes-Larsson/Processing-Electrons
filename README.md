# Processing-Electrons
A small  processing program that draws an electron model and saves it as a png.

# Usage Instructions
Specify the electron configuration by changing the values in the int[] at line 15 in electrons.pde. 
Each int is a layer, where the value specifies the number of electrons. (A lithium atom would for example be { 2, 1 }). 
The core charge is calculated automatically to match the number of electrons. (0 net charge)
